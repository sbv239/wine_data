    "Welcome to your Python coding assessment! In this assignment, you will be working with the famous Wine dataset from Kaggle. Your task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), develop a predictive model, and evaluate its performance. However, before we begin, you need to download the dataset from Kaggle using web scraping.\n",

    "1. Go to the [Wine Reviews dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).\n",
